# Rank-and-Role
Sets ARMA rank and Roles 


in CBA aka addon options, you will see a rank and a role selections

put in a list of steam user ID's 
example:  "7656xxxxxxxxxxxxxx","7656xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" no trailing comma

in the ranks selection try only to put each steam id in one field, ( i'm not really sure what will happen if you put an id in more than one rank, its somewhere between nothing and house cat with nuclear launch codes )
